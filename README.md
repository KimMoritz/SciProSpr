# SciProSpr
First upload of SciProSpr on September 27th

SciProSpr is a tool that helps scientists and others to quickly collect data without using clumsy time-consuming apps like spreadsheet editors or text documents. It allows the user to specify a data input sheet and afterwards just read in the samples in order, with input mode adapted to data type and some data automatically entered. SciProSpr is an abbreviation of Science Protocols and Spreadsheets. It is my hobby project and I am happy to share and discuss the code. I intend to break down the longer methods, but I aim at completing the functionality first.
